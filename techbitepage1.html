            <p class="txt-contents">C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
            C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications.</p>
