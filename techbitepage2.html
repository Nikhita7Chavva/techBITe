     <p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
     <h5>Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of<br> computer science concerned with building smart machines capable<br> of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.<br> AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches,<br> but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are <br>creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </h5>

     <p>MACHINE LEARNING</p>
     <h5>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that<br> automates analytical model building. It is a branch of <br>artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can <br>learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with <br>minimal human intervention.Machine learning is the scientific <br>study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems<br> use to perform a specific task without using explicit<br> instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.<br> It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.</h5>

     <p>ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)</p>
     <h5>Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of <br>technology that allows employees in a company to configure<br> computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret <br>existing applications for processing a transaction, <br>manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating <br>with other digital systems.Robotic process automation is<br> a form of business process automation technology based on<br> metaphorical software robots or artificial intelligence workers. </h5>

     <p>EDGE COMPUTING</p>
     <h5>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm which<br> brings computation and data storage closer to the location<br> where it is needed, to improve response times and save <br>bandwidth.Edge computing optimizes internet devices and web <br>applications by bringing computing closer to the source of the <br>data. This minimizes the need for long distance <br>communications between client and server, <br>which reduces latency and bandwidth usage. </h5>

     <p>VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENTED REALITY</p>
     <h5>Augmented reality and virtual reality are inverse <br>reflections of one in another with what each technology<br> seeks to accomplish and deliver for the user. Virtual reality<br> offers a digital recreation of a real life setting, while augmented<br> reality delivers virtual elements as an overlay to the real<br> world.Virtual reality is possible through a coding<br> language known as VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)<br> which can be used to create a series of images, and specify <br>what types of interactions are possible for them.

     <p>BLOCKCHAIN</p>
     <h5>A blockchain a time-stamped series of immutable records of <br>data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by <br>any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) <br>is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic <br>principles (i.e. chain).The blockchain network has no central <br>authority — it is the very definition of a democratized <br>system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the <br>information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see.<br> Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its<br> very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable <br>for their actions. </h5>

     <p>INTERNET OF THINGS</p>
     <h5>The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing <br>devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are <br>provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a <br>network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.The<br> internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain <br>complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to <br>automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a <br>real-time look into how their systems really work, delivering insights into <br>everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations. </h5>

     <p>CYBER SECURITY</p>
     <h5>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs <br>from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing,<br> changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or <br>interrupting normal business processes.A successful cybersecurity approach has <br>multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, <br>or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, <br>processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective<br> defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate <br>integrations across select Cisco Security products and accelerate key<br> security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. </h5>
